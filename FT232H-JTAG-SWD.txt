JTAG:

Use OpenOCD with the included config file (FT232H-OpenOCD.cfg). It may need some tweaking, so I've annotated that as applicable.

Start openOCD server as this:

sudo /usr/local/bin/openocd -c telnet_port 4444 -f path/to/FT232H-OpenOCD.cfg -f path/to/targe/config.cfg

(added the prefix as fedora doesn't sometimes see it...)

pinout:

D0 == TCK
D1 == TDI
D2 == TDO
D3 == TMS

SWD:

So, we now need to take into account SWDIO as being both TDI and TDO. So, connect SWDIO to TDO, and run a resistor of between 220 and 470Ohm from SWDIO to TDI. This will let you do SWD on a three pin connection. 

D0 == TCK
D1 == SWDIO via resistor
D2 == SWDIO
D3 == TMS
