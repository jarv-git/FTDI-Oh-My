It just works...

plug in device and run `dmesg` and you'll see the device. Usually /dev/ttyUSB0 on linux (could be ttyUSBX if you already have other serial-type devices attached...)

screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

to connect. You can also set 115200 to any other baud rate. Most common are 115200, 9600, 57600.

pinout: 

D0 == Tx
D1 == Rx
